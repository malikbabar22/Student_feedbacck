Student Feedback Form
Role of this Project:

The Student Feedback System was developed to provide a digital platform where students can easily give feedback on their courses, instructors, and overall academic experience. The main goal of the project was to simplify and digitize the manual feedback process typically done using paper forms. Through this system, feedback is securely stored in a database, which helps institutions analyze responses and make necessary improvements in teaching quality and course structure. The project ensures better transparency, faster data collection, and easy report generation for academic improvement.
